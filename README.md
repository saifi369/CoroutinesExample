# Kotlin Coroutines for Android

This project is used for **[Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-LOEBhDCARIsABrC0Tk4Du2iiyq88xodfFZpTh_bHpim_xKVpVwzgwz-ZwISXiWxEgIqVfcaAq3aEALw_wcB)** tutorials on **[U4Universe](https://www.youtube.com/u4universe)** Youtube channel.

# Introduction
A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.

On Android, coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive. Over 50% of professional developers who use coroutines have reported seeing increased productivity.
